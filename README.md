# In Another World As A UM Computer Science Student: The Game

#### Description:
Hello stranger, this is my submission for cs50x final project that I started back in 2023.
In Another World As A UM Computer Science Student: The Game is a text-based rpg
where players traverse a maze-like map, fighting monsters along the way until they
can beat all of the monsters. There is a little bit of story to it just enough to
make it a little more interesting so I won't spoil everything here.

The game was designed with encapsulation and modularization principles in mind,
however, as a newbie to programming (which I still am 2 years later) executing
elegant and modular code proved to be quite difficult. Thus, a lot of the code
and game flow rely on primitive looking switch and if-else statements. This is 
also apparent with the amount of public static/global attributes present to what
are supposedly system class files (Game.java ;-;).

Looking back now, despite all its flaws , I am quite amazed at how well I coded
most of it. For context, this project was my group's submission to WIX1002 Fundamentals
of Programming course but due to my inadequate leadership skills and the group's (including
me) coding skills, I decided that it would be easier for me to code most of the program but
my members still helped with parts of it. I still am glad to have had the group I did for
this project (ChillCoders).
